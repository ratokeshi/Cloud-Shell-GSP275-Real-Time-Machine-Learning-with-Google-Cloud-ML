## Prerequisites VerifyMe##

 -  You have a Google Cloud Platform account and a Google Project (note the Google Project Id) provided by Quiklab. You can find this on the left side of the QwikLab page.
 -  The [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/). Other browsers are currently not supported by Cloud Dataprep.
 
 
### Task 1. Setting up your development environment ##
#### Qwiklab
##### Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access the Google Cloud Platform for the duration of the lab.

#### What you need
To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Time to complete the lab.
Note: If you already have your own personal GCP account or project, do not use it for this lab.

#### Setting up Google Cloud Platform Console
##### How to start your lab and sign in to the Console

1. Click the Start Lab button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.  


Note: You can view the menu with a list of GCP Products and Services by clicking the Navigation menu at the top-left, next to “Google Cloud Platform”.
<walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="devshell-web-preview-button"
                               text="Open Web Preview">
</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
![](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/a6YnJv8GlGae4rnJIbjA27J8c7YApa%2B6noPFkkKxZjk%3D)

- Verify current account from QwikLab
```bash
gcloud auth list
```

- Check your current project.
```bash
gcloud config list project
```
Your current project name is: {{<project-name>}}  
Your current project id is: {{<project-id>}}  
 Be sure to compare this to the display in your Qwiklab after you start the lab. The display looks like this:  
 ![Login Info](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/%2FtHp4GI5VSDyTtdqi3qDFtevuY014F88%2BFow%2FadnRgE%3D)  
 
1. Copy the username, and then click Open Google Console. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Choose an account page.

Tip: Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

1. On the Choose an account page, click Use Another Account.  
 ![Login Info](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/eQ6xPnPn13GjiJP3RWlHWwiMjhooHxTNvzfg1AL2WPw%3D) 
 
1.   The Sign in page opens. Paste the username that you copied from the Connection Details panel. Then copy and paste the password.

Important: You must use the credentials from the Connection Details panel. Do not use your Qwiklabs credentials. If you have your own GCP account, do not use it for this lab (avoids incurring charges).

1. Click through the subsequent pages:

Accept the terms and conditions.
Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
Do not sign up for free trials.
After a few moments, the GCP console opens in this tab.
Note: You can view the menu with a list of GCP Products and Services by clicking the Navigation menu at the top-left, next to “Google Cloud Platform”.

https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/walkthroughs

Writing a Walkthrough
Walkthroughs are written in Markdown - specifically, in CommonMark format, and without HTML - and can be developed using any text editor. You can also add directives to your Walkthrough which include advanced functionality, like spotlighting and adding inline icons, with Walkthrough-specific Markdown to make it easier to follow.

Create Steps
When creating a Walkthrough, headings are important in determining its structure. To set the right title, step headings, and underlying instructions, follow the hierarchy below:

H1 (#) tags for the Walkthrough title. There should only be a single H1 tag in the Walkthrough.
H2 (##) tags for a step title.
H3 (###) tags for a sub-step title.
Here is a sample Markdown file you can use to create a Walkthrough:

# First Walkthrough

## First step

Hello World

### Part 1

Part One Instructions.

### Part 2

Part Two Instructions.

## Conclusion

Done!
Add a Code Block
To callout a code snippet, use backticks as follows:

```
print("hello world")
```
The resulting code snippet comes with a copy-to-clipboard button in the right-hand corner.

Add directives
To add a directive (advanced walkthrough functionality like spotlighting a UI element, displaying an inline icon, and triggering file actions), use the following custom element format:

<walkthrough-directive-name param="optional parameter">
</walkthrough-directive-name>
In this format, 'directive-name' and 'param' are placeholders. For example, if you'd like to use the directive, editor-open-file, and the parameter, filePath, use this format:

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="test/hello.md">
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
Note: Parameters are strings separated by whitespace. Quotes around the parameters are optional. If the parameter does contain whitespace, such as the label text for a spotlight pointer, quotes are required.
Create a spotlight
A spotlight is a visual focus to help users find a specific UI element within Console.

To spotlight a Console element, use this format:

<walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="target" text="label text">
</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
Putting it into practice, if you'd like to spotlight the button to open the web preview window for Cloud Shell, use:

<walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="devshell-web-preview-button"
                               text="Open Cloud Shell">
</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
For elements within the editor, choose to use the editor-spotlight directive. To spotlight an existing hello.md file when a user clicks 'My file', use:

<walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="navigator" filePath="hello.md"
                              text="My file">
</walkthrough-editor-spotlight>
Tip: For UI elements that don't have spotlight IDs, you can use a CSS selector.

Use an inline icon
To effectively call out the use of a Console button, use an inline icon.

For example, <walkthrough-cloud-shell-editor-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-editor-icon> produces an inline icon of the Cloud Shell editor icon Cloud Shell Icon.

Trigger file actions
Additionally, you can have links in your Walkthrough that open useful files for users. To open a file in Cloud Editor as your user walks through your Walkthrough and clicks on the display text, 'Open sample file', use the following directive:

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="path/to/test.md"
                              text="Open sample file">
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
Note, the file must exist on the users' Cloud Shell instance and the provided path must be its relative file path. The file must be located in the Home directory or in any of the Home directory's subdirectories.

Find the right directives
Look up the Walkthrough Markdown Reference for an extensive list of all possible spotlights (and their parameters) available to you.

Launching Walkthroughs in Cloud Shell
There are two ways to kickstart a Walkthrough in Cloud Shell:

Note: To launch a Walkthrough in developer mode, use `cloudshell launch-tutorial -d tutorial-name.md`.
Use the cloudshell launch-tutorial command

Run the following cloudshell command in your Cloud Shell session to launch a Walkthrough from an existing Markdown file, tutorial.md:

cloudshell launch-tutorial tutorial.md
Alternatively, you can use the teachme alias by running the following command in your Cloud Shell session to launch a Walkthrough from an existing file, hello.md:

teachme hello.md
Use 'Open in Cloud Shell'

Alternatively, you can use the 'Open in Cloud Shell' feature to guide your users from a website, blog or open source project, to your Walkthrough hosted in a git repository. The 'Open in Cloud Shell' feature allows for a 'tutorial' parameter, and can be added to the end of the URL as such &tutorial=path/to/file.md to specify the location of the source Markdown file in the repository. This means that the Markdown for a button linked to your Walkthrough would look like:
[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/testuser/myproject&tutorial=resources/hello.md)

https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/walkthrough-markdown-reference

Cloud Shell tutorials, also known as Walkthroughs, help users familiarize themselves with your project quickly and effectively, while being easy to set up and launch. A Cloud Shell Walkthrough is a set of instructions written in CommonMark Markdown. It can also include directives which are Walkthrough specific Markdown expressions to add advanced functionality like spotlighting and project selection.

Refer to the Writing Walkthroughs guide for how to set up, compose, and launch a Walkthrough in Cloud Shell.

Directive format
To add a directive, use the following format:

<walkthrough-directive-name param-name="param-value">
</walkthrough-directive-name>
In this format, 'directive-name' and 'param' are placeholders. For example, if you'd like to use the directive, editor-open-file, and the parameter, filePath, use this format:

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="test/hello.md">
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
Note: Parameters are strings separated by whitespace. Quotes around the parameters are optional. If the parameter does contain whitespace, such as the label text for a spotlight pointer, quotes are required.
Cloud Shell directives
The tables below list the directives, and their respective parameters, available for use when authoring a Cloud Shell Walkthrough.

Walkthrough metadata and layout
